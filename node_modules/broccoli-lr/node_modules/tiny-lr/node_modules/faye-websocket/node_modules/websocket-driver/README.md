# websocket-driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node)

This module provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket protocols that
can be hooked up to any I/O stream. It aims to simplify things by decoupling the
protocol details from the I/O layer, such that users only need to implement code
to stream data in and out of it without needing to know anything about how the
protocol actually works. Think of it as a complete WebSocket system with
pluggable I/O.

Due to this design, you get a lot of things for free. In particular, if you hook
this module up to some I/O object, it will do all of this for you:

* Select the correct server-side driver to talk to the client
* Generate and send both server- and client-side handshakes
* Recognize when the handshake phase completes and the WS protocol begins
* Negotiate subprotocol selection based on `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`
* Negotiate and use extensions via the
  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
  module
* Buffer sent messages until the handshake process is finished
* Deal with proxies that defer delivery of the draft-76 handshake body
* Notify you when the socket is open and closed and when messages arrive
* Recombine fragmented messages
* Dispatch text, binary, ping, pong and close frames
* Manage the socket-closing handshake process
* Automatically reply to ping frames with a matching pong
* Apply masking to messages sent by the client
